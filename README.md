# Simple utility for integrating the latest AlgoDat tests

This utility downloads the latest test suite from https://git.tu-berlin.de/lenard-mollenkopf/algodat-sose21-tests and moves its code files into
your own homework directories.

2. Paste the downloaded program into your Homework-Main-Directory where `Blatt01`, `Blatt02` etc. are lying.
3. To integrate the tests, simply run the command `testjoin` from inside this directory in your terminal.
